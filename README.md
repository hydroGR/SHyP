# SHyP: an open-source Scoreboard interface for displaying and comparing scores for Hydrometeorological Predictions 

SHyP (Scoreboard for Hydrometeorological Predictions) is a scoreboard utility for hydrological and meteorological predictions that aims to help modellers, decision-makers and users to visualize and compare the performance/skill of several models or model configurations in a unique platform allowing for easy comparisons. 

SHyP has been developed with the support of the IMPREX project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 framework program (grant 641811).

SHyP relies on the R programming language and on the PostgreSQL data base management tool. It includes an R shiny interactive interface. 

Full instructions to run the SHyP tool are given in the Read_Me directory. The SHyP tools requires creating a postgreSQL architecture thanks to the scoreboard_empty_structure.sql file in the SQL folder and then to run one of the R codes.
